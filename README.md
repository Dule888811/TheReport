data for new trips. After all the trips, there are a couple of empty lines, then "-"again empty lines and then the 
names of all drivers. My job was to make a report that looks like this: driver name, distance, average speed, new line 
and so for who all has driven, then couple the empty lines are "-", and then the names of the drivers who did not drive.
